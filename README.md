This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to implicit type coercion when working with array keys.  The `increment_array_value` function intends to increment the value associated with a given key. However, the use of both string and numeric keys reveals unexpected behavior due to PHP's loose typing system. The `bug.php` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected approach.
